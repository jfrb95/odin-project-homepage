//TODO: 
// - find good way to scale size of project boxes 
//   - there is a way to somehow get them to change size a bit while also
//   - wrapping as and when.
// - make things (e.g. header image) scale slower than the 
//   - size of the screen in between breakpoints
// - header background is not perfect for all screen sizes
